## Operating Systems Journal



This journal focuses on describing my learning journey on the foundation of Operating Systems. 

Each topic is split by weeks covering:
- [Week 1](/week1.md) - System Planning and Distribution Selection 
- [Week 2](/week2.md) - Security Planning and Testing Methodology
- [Week 3](/week3.md) - Application Selection for Performance Testing
- [Week 4](/week4.md) - Initial System Configuration & Security Implementation
- [Week 5](/week5.md) - Advanced Security and Monitoring Infrastructure
- [Week 6](/week6.md) - Performance Evaluation and Analysis
- [Week 7](/week7.md) - Security Audit and System Evaluation

Data centres consume approximately 1% of global electricity, with projections reaching 3-8%
by 2030 [[1]](/references.md). Optimised OS configurations can reduce server energy consumption by 15-30%
through improved resource utilisation [[2]](/references.md). Understanding how to configure, secure, and
evaluate operating systems is fundamental to computing practice.

### > Employability and Professional Skills
The following list shows the necessary professional skills for OS configuration and security, covered in each week. 
- Deploy and manage a basic Linux server infrastructure
- Configure and harden remote systems using SSH and command-line tools.
- Develop automation scripts for security verification and system monitoring
- Analyse and document technical trade-offs using quantitative data
- Communicate complex technical implementations through written reports and recorded demonstrations
- Implement industry-standard security controls (firewalls, key-based authentication, mandatory access control, intrusion detection)
- Troubleshoot and resolve technical problems in networked environments
- Create professional technical documentation with architecture diagrams and performance visualisations
